    "To systematically evaluate RAG systems, one of the following widely adopted frameworks is typically used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. RAG Triad\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG Triad evaluates a RAG pipeline across three core dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Context Relevance*:\n",
    "How relevant the retrieved documents are to the user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Answer Faithfulness (Groundedness)*:\n",
    "Whether the generated answer is supported by the retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Answer Relevance*:\n",
    "How well the generated answer addresses the user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework is particularly useful when ground truth answers are unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. RAGAS (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment)\n",
    "\n",
    "RAGAS is a more comprehensive evaluation framework designed specifically for RAG systems. It provides a set of metrics that assess both retrieval and generation quality, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Context precision and recall\n",
    "\n",
    "- Answer relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Faithfulness\n",
    "\n",
    "- Answer correctness (when ground truth is available)\n",

You \\ncan then work on your data in Power BI Desktop \\nwithout being connected to the database. You \\nwill only need a connection when you want to \\nrefresh the data. \\nWith DirectQuery, Power BI Desktop does not \\nload the data into its internal database. Instead, \\nit runs a query to the original database every \\ntime it needs to draw a chart or, in general, run a \\nquery. Thus, the connection between Power BI \\nDesktop and the database will be permanent. \\nThe contrast in the query timings reflects a key \\ndifference: when you use Import, you are \\nworking with data that is only as current as the \\nlatest refresh, whereas with DirectQuery you \\nalways see the latest information available when \\nyou create the report.', '141 C H A P T E R  4  |  Using Power BI Desktop \\n \\neliminated Excel as a middle step, saving the \\ntime and effort required to prepare that file. \\nLoading from multiple \\nsources \\nWorking directly with a database looks great, \\nbut, after further investigation, David \\nexperienced an unpleasant surprise: by using \\nExcel, he was able to integrate into the same \\ntable both the sales, which came from SQL \\nServer, and the budget forecasts, which came \\nfrom an Excel file. However, the Excel file \\ncontaining the forecast cannot be gathered from \\nthe SQL Server database, because the \\ncountry/region managers update the Excel file \\nwhenever they want to share some new figures \\nfor 2016. \\nTo solve this problem, we need to dive a bit \\nmore into the internal structure of the Power BI \\nDesktop model. In Chapter 3, we said that a \\nPower BI Desktop model contains an internal \\nquery, created by Power BI Desktop, for each \\ndataset. This internal query is not visible if you \\nperform basic operations, such as loading data \\nfrom an Excel file or from a SQL Server database. \\nYet, it is there, and if you need to modify it, you \\ncan.', '85 C H A P T E R  2  |  Sharing the dashboard \\n \\nDavid selects Import Excel Data Into Power BI by \\nclicking the Import button in that section. \\n \\nFigure 2-19: Click the Import button to bring in the \\ncon\\ntent of an Excel file stored in OneDrive for \\nBusiness. \\nDavid now has a dataset available, named Sales \\n2015 And Budget 2016.

In fact, there is a \\nlot more to learn about Power BI Desktop, but \\nthat would be beyond the scope of this book. \\nHere are the most relevant features: \\n\\uf0b7 Power BI Desktop can load data from any \\ndatabase. In the example in this chapter, we \\nused Microsoft SQL Server. \\n\\uf0b7 Using Power BI Desktop, you can load data \\nfrom multiple sources. In the example, we \\nmixed data from Excel with data residing in a \\nSQL Server database. \\n\\uf0b7 Power BI Desktop uses Query Editor to load \\ndata. Query Editor offers many powerful \\nfeatures. We highlighted in particular the \\ncapability of merging different queries and \\nadding calculations to the query. \\n\\uf0b7 Some queries are loaded into the model; \\nothers are useful only to compute values in \\nthe main query. You can mark queries that', '8 C H A P T E R  1  |  Introducing Power BI \\n \\nAfter reading the descriptions, David correctly \\nconcludes that Power BI Desktop is designed for \\nmore advanced tasks. Given that he’s just \\nbeginning to learn about it, he opts for plain, \\nvanilla Power BI. \\nWhen David clicks the Sign Up button, the \\nscreen shown in Figure 1-4 appears. Power BI is a \\nweb service to which you can upload data and \\nbuild insightful dashboards and charts. As with \\nany web service, you need to sign in, but Power \\nBI does not require much in the way of \\ncredentials: to get started, all you need is a \\nvalid email address, which David provides. \\n \\nFigure 1-4: You need only a valid email address to \\ngain access to Power BI. \\nAfter clicking Sign Up, Power BI informs David \\nthat he already has a subscription to Microsoft', '113 C H A P T E R  3  |  Understanding data refresh \\n \\n \\nFigure 3-4: The Power BI Desktop UI resembles the \\nPower BI website. \\nThe first thing you will probably notice is that the \\nUI of Power BI Desktop is very similar to that of \\nPower BI. Nevertheless, as you will learn, there is \\nmore to Power BI Desktop, and it is a bit more \\ncomplex to use than its web-based counterpart, \\nbut it exploits the full power of the Power BI \\nengine. \\nAs with Power BI, the first step is to provide \\nsome data to Power BI Desktop. Because the \\noriginal data is in Excel, you can begin practicing \\nwith Power BI Desktop by using the same Excel \\nfile you used earlier for the website. On the \\nribbon, in the Data group, click Get Data, and \\nthen click Excel (see Figure 3-5).', '111 C H A P T E R  3  |  Understanding data refresh \\n \\nIntroducing Power BI \\nDesktop \\nYou might remember from Chapter 1 that Power \\nBI offers you two ways of interacting with it: \\ndirect access to the web service, or by using \\nPower BI Desktop. In this section, we are going \\nto show you how to use Power BI Desktop. \\nPower BI Desktop is an application that runs \\nlocally on your computer but offers you all of the \\nfeatures available on the web, plus many more \\noptions for building a data model. \\nBy using Power BI Desktop, you do not rely on \\nthe web service to create the data model for you. \\nInstead, you have the full modeling capabilities \\nof Power BI available at your disposal and \\ncontrol. \\nWhy should you worry about Power BI Desktop \\nat all if the web service is capable of building a \\nmodel for you? There are several reason for this, \\nbut for now, let’s concentrate on one of those \\nreasons: you can describe the details of your \\ndataset, which accomplishes the first \\nrequirement of our data-refresh scenarios from \\nthe preceding section. But, before we can get to \\nthat, first you need to download Power BI \\nDesktop from the Power BI website and install it.']\n",

Power BI cannot \\nreplace your brain when it comes to interpreting \\nthe numbers, but it can prove extremely useful \\nbecause it can easily find some points of \\ninterests in your data by using the brute force of \\nalgorithms. \\nThe best way you can use Quick Insights is to \\nbrowse through them, looking for the \\nconfirmation of what you already know about \\nyour data and, at the same time, for fresh ideas. \\nIt might be the case that some of the insights are \\nnot really meaningful, but, with the sheer \\nnumber of insights that Power BI finds for you, \\nit’s likely that there are some real hidden gems \\nthat might improve your knowledge of your \\nnumbers. \\nMore info You can find a more complete \\ndescription of the algorithms used by Power BI \\nand the types of insights that it can reveal by \\ngoing to https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-\\nUS/documentation/powerbi-service-auto-\\ninsights-types/. Of course, with newer versions \\nof the analytics engine, the numbers and the \\nquality of insights might change and improve.', '18 C H A P T E R  1  |  Introducing Power BI \\n \\nBut, what are these insights? \\nThe basic idea is that Power BI can use artificial \\nintelligence to analyze your data, searching for \\nsome useful or interesting patterns. It uses very \\nsophisticated algorithms whose speed depends \\non the size and complexity of the dataset. \\nObviously, on a small dataset such as the one \\nDavid uploaded, finding insights takes no more \\nthan a few seconds. As soon as the search is \\ncomplete, you can access it. On the Insights Are \\nReady dialog box, David clicks View Insights. \\nFigure 1-12 presents the first two insights that \\nPower BI found on David’s file. Many others are \\nwithin the list, so many, in fact, that they would \\nnot fit on the page in this book. David scrolls \\ndown to view them all.', '13 C H A P T E R  1  |  Introducing Power BI \\n \\nReferring back to Figure 1-7, the central pane is \\npositioned on the 2015 Sales dashboard and, \\nbecause David has loaded the file but has not \\nyet performed any analysis on the data it \\ncontains, the dashboard is essentially empty, \\nshowing only the Ask A Question box and the \\n2015 Sales.xlsx tile, which indicates that the \\ndashboard is indeed connected to his Excel \\nworkbook. \\nIntroducing natural-\\nlanguage queries \\nWith Power BI, you have the ability to carry out \\nanalysis of your data by asking it questions, in \\nplain English—no special code or syntax is \\nrequired. This feature is called natural-language \\nqueries, and with it, you can ask Power BI to \\nperform tasks in much the same way you would \\nask one of your colleagues. Let’s take a look at \\nan example of how David uses natural-language \\nqueries in Power BI.', '14 C H A P T E R  1  |  Introducing Power BI \\n \\nIn the central pane, in the question box, David \\ntypes a simple query: “Show sales 2015 by \\nbrand.” Power BI understands the query and \\npresents a bar chart (see Figure 1-8) in which the \\nbrands are displayed alphabetically and the \\nlength of the bars is proportional to the \\ncorresponding sales for each brand in 2015. \\n \\nFigure 1-8: Power BI understands queries in natural \\nlanguage and displays the data you request. \\nNot only did Power BI understand David’s query, \\nbut, after performing an analysis of his dataset, it \\nalso suggests other meaningful queries in a list \\nthat appeared when he began to type the query. \\nFor David’s data, that analysis revealed that he \\nmight also be interested in viewing sales in 2015 \\nby country/region or by month, so Power BI \\nsuggests those as alternate queries.', '16 C H A P T E R  1  |  Introducing Power BI \\n \\n \\nFigure 1-10: The dashboard is a container for \\nvisu\\nalizations created on top of datasets. \\nUsing natural-language queries is quite \\nimpressive, but it is only one of the many ways in \\nwhich Power BI can analyze your data. \\nIntroducing Quick \\nInsights \\nAnother feature that is worth learning as soon as \\nyou begin using Power BI is Quick Insights. With \\nthis feature, Power BI can search a dataset for \\ninteresting patterns and provide you with a list \\nof charts that help you to better understand your \\ndata. \\nTo activate Quick Insights, click the ellipsis to the \\nright of the dataset (see Figure 1-11) on which \\nyou want to perform the analysis: in David’s case,']\n",

You \\ncan then work on your data in Power BI Desktop \\nwithout being connected to the database. You \\nwill only need a connection when you want to \\nrefresh the data. \\nWith DirectQuery, Power BI Desktop does not \\nload the data into its internal database. Instead, \\nit runs a query to the original database every \\ntime it needs to draw a chart or, in general, run a \\nquery. Thus, the connection between Power BI \\nDesktop and the database will be permanent. \\nThe contrast in the query timings reflects a key \\ndifference: when you use Import, you are \\nworking with data that is only as current as the \\nlatest refresh, whereas with DirectQuery you \\nalways see the latest information available when \\nyou create the report.', '141 C H A P T E R  4  |  Using Power BI Desktop \\n \\neliminated Excel as a middle step, saving the \\ntime and effort required to prepare that file. \\nLoading from multiple \\nsources \\nWorking directly with a database looks great, \\nbut, after further investigation, David \\nexperienced an unpleasant surprise: by using \\nExcel, he was able to integrate into the same \\ntable both the sales, which came from SQL \\nServer, and the budget forecasts, which came \\nfrom an Excel file.

In the example, we \\nmixed data from Excel with data residing in a \\nSQL Server database. \\n\\uf0b7 Power BI Desktop uses Query Editor to load \\ndata. Query Editor offers many powerful \\nfeatures. We highlighted in particular the \\ncapability of merging different queries and \\nadding calculations to the query. \\n\\uf0b7 Some queries are loaded into the model; \\nothers are useful only to compute values in \\nthe main query. You can mark queries that', '8 C H A P T E R  1  |  Introducing Power BI \\n \\nAfter reading the descriptions, David correctly \\nconcludes that Power BI Desktop is designed for \\nmore advanced tasks. Given that he’s just \\nbeginning to learn about it, he opts for plain, \\nvanilla Power BI. \\nWhen David clicks the Sign Up button, the \\nscreen shown in Figure 1-4 appears. Power BI is a \\nweb service to which you can upload data and \\nbuild insightful dashboards and charts. As with \\nany web service, you need to sign in, but Power \\nBI does not require much in the way of \\ncredentials: to get started, all you need is a \\nvalid email address, which David provides. \\n \\nFigure 1-4: You need only a valid email address to \\ngain access to Power BI. \\nAfter clicking Sign Up, Power BI informs David \\nthat he already has a subscription to Microsoft', '113 C H A P T E R  3  |  Understanding data refresh \\n \\n \\nFigure 3-4: The Power BI Desktop UI resembles the \\nPower BI website. \\nThe first thing you will probably notice is that the \\nUI of Power BI Desktop is very similar to that of \\nPower BI. Nevertheless, as you will learn, there is \\nmore to Power BI Desktop, and it is a bit more \\ncomplex to use than its web-based counterpart, \\nbut it exploits the full power of the Power BI \\nengine. \\nAs with Power BI, the first step is to provide \\nsome data to Power BI Desktop. Because the \\noriginal data is in Excel, you can begin practicing \\nwith Power BI Desktop by using the same Excel \\nfile you used earlier for the website. On the \\nribbon, in the Data group, click Get Data, and \\nthen click Excel (see Figure 3-5).', '111 C H A P T E R  3  |  Understanding data refresh \\n \\nIntroducing Power BI \\nDesktop \\nYou might remember from Chapter 1 that Power \\nBI offers you two ways of interacting with it: \\ndirect access to the web service, or by using \\nPower BI Desktop. In this section, we are going \\nto show you how to use Power BI Desktop. \\nPower BI Desktop is an application that runs \\nlocally on your computer but offers you all of the \\nfeatures available on the web, plus many more \\noptions for building a data model. \\nBy using Power BI Desktop, you do not rely on \\nthe web service to create the data model for you. \\nInstead, you have the full modeling capabilities \\nof Power BI available at your disposal and \\ncontrol. \\nWhy should you worry about Power BI Desktop \\nat all if the web service is capable of building a \\nmodel for you? There are several reason for this, \\nbut for now, let’s concentrate on one of those \\nreasons: you can describe the details of your \\ndataset, which accomplishes the first \\nrequirement of our data-refresh scenarios from \\nthe preceding section. But, before we can get to \\nthat, first you need to download Power BI \\nDesktop from the Power BI website and install it.']\n",

The first node highlights that 'Power BI can easily find some points of interests in your data by using the brute force of algorithms,' which is directly relevant. The second node further supports this by stating 'Power BI can use artificial intelligence to analyze your data.'

Power BI cannot \\nreplace your brain when it comes to interpreting \\nthe numbers, but it can prove extremely useful \\nbecause it can easily find some points of \\ninterests in your data by using the brute force of \\nalgorithms. \\nThe best way you can use Quick Insights is to \\nbrowse through them, looking for the \\nconfirmation of what you already know about \\nyour data and, at the same time, for fresh ideas. \\nIt might be the case that some of the insights are \\nnot really meaningful, but, with the sheer \\nnumber of insights that Power BI finds for you, \\nit’s likely that there are some real hidden gems \\nthat might improve your knowledge of your \\nnumbers. \\nMore info You can find a more complete \\ndescription of the algorithms used by Power BI \\nand the types of insights that it can reveal by \\ngoing to https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-\\nUS/documentation/powerbi-service-auto-\\ninsights-types/. Of course, with newer versions \\nof the analytics engine, the numbers and the \\nquality of insights might change and improve.', '18 C H A P T E R  1  |  Introducing Power BI \\n \\nBut, what are these insights? \\nThe basic idea is that Power BI can use artificial \\nintelligence to analyze your data, searching for \\nsome useful or interesting patterns. It uses very \\nsophisticated algorithms whose speed depends \\non the size and complexity of the dataset. \\nObviously, on a small dataset such as the one \\nDavid uploaded, finding insights takes no more \\nthan a few seconds. As soon as the search is \\ncomplete, you can access it. On the Insights Are \\nReady dialog box, David clicks View Insights. \\nFigure 1-12 presents the first two insights that \\nPower BI found on David’s file. Many others are \\nwithin the list, so many, in fact, that they would \\nnot fit on the page in this book. David scrolls \\ndown to view them all.', '13 C H A P T E R  1  |  Introducing Power BI \\n \\nReferring back to Figure 1-7, the central pane is \\npositioned on the 2015 Sales dashboard and, \\nbecause David has loaded the file but has not \\nyet performed any analysis on the data it \\ncontains, the dashboard is essentially empty, \\nshowing only the Ask A Question box and the \\n2015 Sales.xlsx tile, which indicates that the \\ndashboard is indeed connected to his Excel \\nworkbook. \\nIntroducing natural-\\nlanguage queries \\nWith Power BI, you have the ability to carry out \\nanalysis of your data by asking it questions, in \\nplain English—no special code or syntax is \\nrequired. This feature is called natural-language \\nqueries, and with it, you can ask Power BI to \\nperform tasks in much the same way you would \\nask one of your colleagues. Let’s take a look at \\nan example of how David uses natural-language \\nqueries in Power BI.', '14 C H A P T E R  1  |  Introducing Power BI \\n \\nIn the central pane, in the question box, David \\ntypes a simple query: “Show sales 2015 by \\nbrand.” Power BI understands the query and \\npresents a bar chart (see Figure 1-8) in which the \\nbrands are displayed alphabetically and the \\nlength of the bars is proportional to the \\ncorresponding sales for each brand in 2015. \\n \\nFigure 1-8: Power BI understands queries in natural \\nlanguage and displays the data you request. \\nNot only did Power BI understand David’s query, \\nbut, after performing an analysis of his dataset, it \\nalso suggests other meaningful queries in a list \\nthat appeared when he began to type the query. \\nFor David’s data, that analysis revealed that he \\nmight also be interested in viewing sales in 2015 \\nby country/region or by month, so Power BI \\nsuggests those as alternate queries.', '16 C H A P T E R  1  |  Introducing Power BI \\n \\n \\nFigure 1-10: The dashboard is a container for \\nvisu\\nalizations created on top of datasets. \\nUsing natural-language queries is quite \\nimpressive, but it is only one of the many ways in \\nwhich Power BI can analyze your data. \\nIntroducing Quick \\nInsights \\nAnother feature that is worth learning as soon as \\nyou begin using Power BI is Quick Insights. With \\nthis feature, Power BI can search a dataset for \\ninteresting patterns and provide you with a list \\nof charts that help you to better understand your \\ndata. \\nTo activate Quick Insights, click the ellipsis to the \\nright of the dataset (see Figure 1-11) on which \\nyou want to perform the analysis: in David’s case,']\n",
